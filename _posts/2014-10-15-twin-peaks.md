**Shawn Watches Twin peaks**\\
*A review, done by Haiku*\\
*One per episode*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

<hr>
Empty Netflix Queue\\
I need a new show to watch\\
Some cult show: Twin Peaks
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**1.**\\
Striking scenery\\
Soap opera and campy\\
Terrible Music
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**2.**\\
The pilot was strange\\
I reluctantly hit next\\
Giving it a chance
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**3.**\\
Things are getting odd\\
I dislike David Lynch stuff\\
Still hate that music
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**4.**\\
Half through the season\\
Only four episodes left\\
May as well finish
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**5.**\\
It's starting to drag\\
The music never changes\\
Just the four same themes
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**6.**\\
I have no idea\\
what is even happening\\
in this freaking show
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**7.**\\
Still no answers -- but\\
Stockholm Syndrome has set in\\
I love this music
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**8.**\\
Wait. What?.... I... that... can't...\\
Not the closure I hoped for\\
Time for Season Two
