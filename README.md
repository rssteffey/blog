## Theoretical startup

Just run
`bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`

Maybe with a
`bundle install`
first if you're on a new system

Don't forget to install the correct ruby version with asdf (should respect the version noted in `.tool-versions`)


## When that inevitably doesn't work

One thing I've discovered about coming back to a blog every two years is that Ruby breaks constantly.  Check [Pages Dependencies](https://pages.github.com/versions/) to see what needs updating (likely Ruby or Jekyll or Webrick)

## When that also fails
My advice is just to write blind and let the cloud build the results it will.  
You only have 4,000 weeks on this earth - don't waste any of them debugging which package needs fixing.
